## Title of the Project
AI-Driven Personal Gym Assistant
## About
The AI-Driven Personal Gym Assistant is an advanced fitness application that combines computer vision, AI-powered coaching, and personalized meal planning to enhance the workout experience. The system uses MediaPipe Pose Estimation to provide real-time feedback on exercise form, rep counting, and posture correction. It also integrates an AI chatbot via the Groq Cloud API to assist users with fitness and nutrition-related queries. Additionally, it includes a diet planner using the Spoonacular API, which generates personalized meal recommendations based on caloric intake goals. This project is developed with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly and interactive interface.

## Features
Real-Time Exercise Tracking – Uses MediaPipe Pose Estimation to track workouts and provide posture feedback. AI Chatbot for Fitness & Nutrition – Integrates Groq Cloud API to assist users with fitness-related queries. Personalized Meal Planning – Fetches diet recommendations via Spoonacular API based on user caloric needs. Automated Rep Counting & Form Analysis – Provides real-time performance tracking during workouts. User-Friendly Interface – Built using Streamlit, ensuring an interactive and accessible experience. Scalable and Flexible – Can be expanded to support additional workout types and diet customization.

## Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
